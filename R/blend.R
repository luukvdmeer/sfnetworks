#' Blend geospatial points into a spatial network
#'
#' Blending a point into a network is the combined process of first snapping
#' the given point to its nearest point on its nearest edge in the network,
#' subsequently splitting that edge at the location of the snapped point, and
#' finally adding the snapped point as node to the network. If the location
#' of the snapped point is already a node in the network, the attributes of the
#' point (if any) will be joined to that node.
#'
#' @param x An object of class \code{\link{sfnetwork}}.
#'
#' @param y The spatial features to be blended, either as object of class
#' \code{\link[sf]{sf}} or \code{\link[sf]{sfc}}, with \code{POINT} geometries.
#'
#' @param tolerance The tolerance distance to be used. Only features that are
#' at least as close to the network as the tolerance distance will be blended.
#' Should be a non-negative number preferably given as an object of class
#' \code{\link[units]{units}}. Otherwise, it will be assumed that the unit is
#' meters. If set to \code{Inf} all features will be blended. Defaults to
#' \code{Inf}.
#'
#' @return The blended network as an object of class \code{\link{sfnetwork}}.
#'
#' @details There are two important details to be aware of. Firstly: when the
#' snap locations of multiple points are equal, only the first of these points
#' is blended into the network. By arranging \code{y} before blending you can
#' influence which (type of) point is given priority in such cases.
#' Secondly: when the snap location of a point intersects with multiple edges,
#' it is only blended into the first of these edges. You might want to run the
#' \code{\link{to_spatial_subdivision}} morpher after blending, such that
#' intersecting but unconnected edges get connected.
#'
#' @note Due to internal rounding of rational numbers, it may occur that the
#' intersection point between a line and a point is not evaluated as
#' actually intersecting that line by the designated algorithm. Instead, the
#' intersection point lies a tiny-bit away from the edge. Therefore, it is
#' recommended to set the tolerance to a very small number (for example 1e-5)
#' even if you only want to blend points that intersect the line.
