#' Smooth pseudo nodes
#'
#' Construct a smoothed version of the network by iteratively removing pseudo
#' nodes, while preserving the connectivity of the network. In the case of
#' directed networks, pseudo nodes are those nodes that have only one incoming
#' and one outgoing edge. In undirected networks, pseudo nodes are those nodes
#' that have two incident edges. Equality of attribute values among the two
#' edges can be defined as an additional requirement by setting the
#' \code{require_equal} parameter. Connectivity of the network is preserved by
#' concatenating the incident edges of each removed pseudo node.
#'
#' @param x An object of class \code{\link{sfnetwork}}.
#'
#' @param protect An integer vector of edge indices specifying which nodes
#' should be protected from being removed. Defaults to \code{NULL}, meaning
#' that none of the nodes is protected.
#'
#' @param require_equal A character vector of edge column names specifying
#' which attributes of the incident edges of a pseudo node should be equal in
#' order for the pseudo node to be removed? Defaults to \code{NULL}, meaning
#' that attribute equality is not considered for pseudo node removal.
#'
#' @param attribute_summary How should the attributes of concatenated edges
#' be summarized? There are several options, see
#' \code{\link[igraph]{igraph-attribute-combination}} for details.
#'
#' @param store_original_ids For each concatenated edge, should the indices of
#' the original edges be stored as an attribute of the new edge, in a column
#' named \code{.tidygraph_edge_index}? This is in line with the design
#' principles of \code{tidygraph}. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
#'
#' @param store_original_data For each concatenated edge, should the data of
#' the original edges be stored as an attribute of the new edge, in a column
#' named \code{.orig_data}? This is in line with the design principles of
#' \code{tidygraph}. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
#'
#' @returns The smoothed network as object of class \code{\link{sfnetwork}}.
