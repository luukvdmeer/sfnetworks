  - title: Construction
    desc: >
      The core of the package is an sfnetwork data structure that can be 
      provided directly to both graph analytical functions of tidygraph 
      and spatial analytical functions of sf.
    contents:
      - sfnetwork
      - as_sfnetwork
      - is.sfnetwork
  - title: Extensions
    desc: >
       Some problems are so specific to spatial networks, that they can neither
       be solved by tidygraph nor sf. Therefore, sfnetworks contains several 
       extensions to the current offer of the two "parent packages".
    contents:
      - spatial_shortest_paths
      - spatial_edge_measures
      - spatial_morphers
  - title: Integration with sf
    desc: >
      The sfnetworks package supports a wide range of sf functions to be
      directly applied to the network.
    contents:
      - sf
      - sf_attr
  - title: Integration with tidygraph
    desc: >
      Since sfnetwork objects subclass tbl_graph objects, most tidygraph 
      functions work automatically. However, some of them need a special 
      method, mostly as a result of the presence of the sticky geometry 
      list column in sfnetwork objects.
    contents:
      - tidygraph
  - title: Visualization
    desc: >
      The sfnetworks package does not (yet?) include advanced visualization 
      options. However, a simple plot method is provided, which gives a quick 
      view of how the network looks like.
