  - title: Construction & conversion
    desc: >
      At the core of the package lies the `sfnetwork` class to represent
      spatial networks. There are several ways to construct instances of this
      class, and to convert them to other classes.
    contents:
      - sfnetwork
      - as_sfnetwork
      - create_from_spatial_lines
      - create_from_spatial_points
      - play_spatial
      - sfnetwork_to_dodgr
      - nb
      - as.linnet
  - title: Analysis
    desc: >
      The package enables an integrated analysis workflow that combines
      `tidygraph` and `sf`. On top of this, it extends the functionalities of
      those two packages with a set of analytical functions specific for
      spatial network analysis.

      - st_network_bbox
      - st_network_blend
      - st_network_cost
      - st_network_faces
      - st_network_iso
      - st_network_join
      - st_network_paths
      - st_network_travel
      - st_project_on_network
      - spatial_centrality
      - spatial_node_types
      - spatial_node_predicates
      - node_coordinates
      - spatial_edge_measures

  - title: Utilities
    desc: >
      The package exports different kind of utility and internal functions that
      are meant to make spatial network analysis smoother, and fitting both
      into tidyverse and non-tidyverse workflows.
  - subtitle: Data extraction
    desc: >
      These functions are about the extraction of data from a network.
    contents:
      - data
      - ids
      - nearest
      - nearest_ids
      - 'n'
  - subtitle: Edge geometries
    desc: >
      These functions allow to modify edge geometries.
    contents:
      - make_edges_directed
      - make_edges_mixed
      - make_edges_explicit
      - make_edges_implicit
      - make_edges_follow_indices
      - make_edges_valid
  - subtitle: Network cleaning
    desc: >
      These functions are the internal workers behind the spatial morphers that
      are dedicted to network cleaning. They are exported to make it possible
      to do network cleaning outside of tidyverse workflows.
    contents:
      - contract_nodes
      - simplify_network
      - smooth_pseudo_nodes
      - subdivide_edges
  - subtitle: Internals
    desc: >
      These are internal functions that are not meant to be called directly by
      users. They are exported such that developers aiming to extend the
      package can use them.
    contents:
      - evaluate_weight_spec
      - evaluate_node_query
      - evaluate_edge_query
  - subtitle: Other
    desc: >
      These are other utility functions that do not fit in the categories above.
    contents:
      - dual_weights
      - is_sfnetwork
      - sf_attr
      - st_duplicated
      - st_match
