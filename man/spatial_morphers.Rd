\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{\link{sfnetwork}}.}

\item{...}{Arguments to be passed on to other functions. See the description
of each morpher for details.}

\item{remove_parallels}{Should parallel edges be removed. Defaults to
\code{TRUE}.}

\item{remove_loops}{Should loops be remove. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{store_orig_data}{Whenever multiple features (i.e. nodes and/or edges)
are merged into a single feature during morphing, should the data of the
original features be stored as an attribute of the new feature, in a column
named \code{.orig_data}. This is in line with the design principles of
\code{tidygraph}. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{subset_by}{Whether to create subgraphs based on nodes or edges.}

\item{node}{The starting node that must be used for estimating the spatial local
neighborhood}

\value{
Either a \code{morphed_sfnetwork}, which is a list of one or more
\code{\link{sfnetwork}} objects, or a \code{morphed_tbl_graph}, which is a
list of one or more \code{\link[tidygraph]{tbl_graph}} objects. See the
description of each morpher for details.
}
\description{
Spatial morphers form spatial add-ons to the set of
\code{\link[tidygraph]{morphers}} provided by \code{tidygraph}. These
functions are not meant to be called directly. They should either be passed
into \code{\link[tidygraph]{morph}} to create a temporary alternative
representation of the input network. Such an alternative representation is a
list of one or more network objects. Single elements of that list can be
extracted directly as a new network by passing the morpher to
\code{\link[tidygraph]{convert}} instead, to make the changes lasting rather
than temporary. Alternatively, if the morphed state contains multiple
elements, all of them can be extracted together inside a
\code{\link[tibble]{tbl_df}} by passing the morpher to
\code{\link[tidygraph]{crystallise}}.
}
\details{
It also possible to create your own morphers. See the documentation
of \code{\link[tidygraph]{morph}} for the requirements for custom morphers.

\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{to_spatial_directed}: Make a network directed in the direction given
by the linestring geometries of the edges. Differs from
\code{\link[tidygraph]{to_directed}}, which makes a network directed based
on the node indices given in the \code{from} and \code{to} columns. In
undirected networks these indices may not correspond with the endpoints of
the linestring geometries. Returns a \code{morphed_sfnetwork} containing a
single element of class \code{\link{sfnetwork}}. This morpher requires edges
to be spatially explicit. If not, use \code{\link[tidygraph]{to_directed}}.

\item \code{to_spatial_explicit}: Create linestring geometries between source
and target nodes of edges. If the edges data can be directly converted to
an object of class \code{\link[sf]{sf}} using \code{\link[sf]{st_as_sf}},
extra arguments can be provided as \code{...} and will be forwarded to
\code{\link[sf]{st_as_sf}} internally. Otherwise, straight lines will be
drawn between the source and target node of each edge. Returns a
\code{morphed_sfnetwork} containing a single element of class
\code{\link{sfnetwork}}.

\item \code{to_spatial_shortest_paths}: Limit a network to those nodes and edges that
are part of the shortest path between two nodes. \code{...} is evaluated in
the same manner as \code{\link{st_network_paths}} with
\code{type = 'shortest'}. Returns a \code{morphed_sfnetwork} that may
contain multiple elements of class \code{\link{sfnetwork}}, depending on
the number of requested paths. When unmorphing only the first instance of
both the node and edge data will be used, as the the same node and/or edge
can be present in multiple paths.

\item \code{to_spatial_simple}: Remove loops and parallel edges. Returns a
\code{morphed_sfnetwork} containing a single element of class
\code{\link{sfnetwork}}.

\item \code{to_spatial_smooth}: Construct a smoothed version of the network by
iteratively removing pseudo nodes, while preserving the connectivity of the
network. In the case of directed networks, pseudo nodes are those nodes that
have only one incoming and one outgoing edge. In undirected networks, pseudo
nodes are those nodes that have two incident edges. Connectivity of the
network is preserved by concatenating the incident edges of each removed
pseudo node. Returns a \code{morphed_sfnetwork} containing a single element
of class \code{\link{sfnetwork}}.

\item \code{to_spatial_subdivision}: Construct a subdivision of the network by
subdividing edges at each interior point that is equal to any
other interior or boundary point in the edges table. Interior points in this
sense are those points that are included in their linestring geometry
feature but are not endpoints of it, while boundary points are the endpoints
of the linestrings. The network is reconstructed after subdivision such that
edges are connected at the points of subdivision. Returns a
\code{morphed_sfnetwork} containing a single element of class
\code{\link{sfnetwork}}. This morpher requires edges to be spatially
explicit.

\item \code{to_spatial_subset}: Subset the network by applying a spatial
filter, i.e. a filter on the geometry column based on a spatial predicate.
\code{...} is evaluated in the same manner as \code{\link[sf]{st_filter}}.
Returns a \code{morphed_sfnetwork} containing a single element of class
\code{\link{sfnetwork}}. For filters on an attribute column, use
\code{\link[tidygraph]{to_subgraph}}.

\item \code{to_spatial_transformed}: Transform the geospatial coordinates of the
network into a different coordinate reference system. \code{...} is
evaluated in the same manner as \code{\link[sf]{st_transform}}.
Returns a \code{morphed_sfnetwork} containing a single element of class
\code{\link{sfnetwork}}.

\item \code{to_spatial_local_neighborhood}: For a given \code{node}, it subsets only the
vertices which are closer than a given \code{distance}. The edges' lengths
are determined using the \code{weight} attribute from edges' table. If no
\code{weight} attribute is present, then the geographic edge lengths will
be calculated internally and used as weights. This morpher can be used to
estimate isochrones and isodistances.
