# sfnetworks v0.6.5

### Bug fixes

* The `print()` method for sfnetwork objects now correctly prints networks with active edges that are spatially implicit. Refs [#256](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/256).
* The `print()` method for sfnetwork objects no longer uses the deprecated function `tibble::trunc_mat()`. Refs [#247](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/247).
* `to_spatial_contracted()` now correctly handles group indices that are not ordered. Refs [#243](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/243). Thanks @MattArran.

### Maintenance

* The usage of `igraph::adjacent_vertices()` and `igraph::incident_edges()` inside `to_spatial_smooth()` is now aligned to updates in igraph v2.1.1 that changed the zero-based indexing of the return to one-based indexing. This alignment is done dynamically, without forcing the most recent igraph version as required dependency. Refs [#282](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/282). Thanks @krlmlr.
* Whenever the installed igraph version is >= 2.1.0, `igraph::get_edge_ids()` is used instead of the deprecated `igraph::get.edge.ids()` inside `to_spatial_smooth()`.

# sfnetworks v0.6.4

### New features

* The `sfnetwork()` construction function now has an argument `message` which can be set to `FALSE` when the network validity checks should not print informational messages to the console. Refs [#261](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/261).

### Maintenance

* Code and documentation was updated where needed to align with changes in base R and/or package dependencies. No changes to program logic or behavior.

# sfnetworks v0.6.3

### Bug fixes

* Argument names of sfnetwork S3 methods for `sf::st_geometry()`, `sf::st_bbox()`, `sf::st_m_range()` and `sf::st_set_precision()` are updated to be consistent with their corresponding generic functions in sf.
* Arguments `active` and `...` are removed from the sfnetwork S3 method for `sf::st_precision()` to be consistent with its corresponding generic function in sf.
* Argument `active` is removed from the sfnetwork S3 method for `sf::st_crs()` to be consistent with the above-mentioned change regarding `sf::st_precision()` (since both CRS and precision can not differ between nodes and edges).

# sfnetworks v0.6.2

### Bug fixes

* The `to_spatial_contracted()` morpher now correctly handles cases for undirected networks in which only loop edges are created after contraction. Refs [#237](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/237).

### Refactoring

* The `to_spatial_contracted()` morpher now directly returns the original network when none of the contraction groups contain more than one node.

### Other

* Umbrella packages tidyverse and spatstat are no longer suggested packages. Only individual members of these packages are now suggested packages.
* Updated unit tests.

# sfnetworks v0.6.1

### Bug fixes

* Unit tests in `test_join.R` now successfully run also on R-devel.

### Refactoring

* Updated plot algorithm to be faster and more efficient. Refs [#226](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/226).

# sfnetworks v0.6.0 "Coerde"

### New features

* Updates to `to_spatial_smooth()` morpher:
  - Argument `summarise_attributes` added to summarise attribute values of concatenated edges. Refs [#120](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/120).
  - Argument `require_equal` added to specify if and which attributes should be checked for equality before removing a pseudo node. Refs [#124](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/124).
  - Argument `protect` added to specify nodes that should never be removed, even if they are a pseudo node. Refs [#177](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/177).
  - Concatenated edges after smoothing are now allowed to cross themselves. Refs [#117](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/117).
* Updates to `st_network_cost()`:
  - Duplicated nodes are now accepted in the `to` argument. Refs [#183](
  https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/183).
  - Cost matrix output now contains units. Refs [#119](
  https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/119).
  - Argument `direction` added to specify if outbound, inbound or all edges should be considered. This replaces the argument `mode` from `igraph::distances()`. The default is "out", while before it was "all". For undirected networks this argument is ignored.
* Edge measure function `edge_azimuth()` gained an argument `degrees` which can be set to `TRUE` to return angles in degrees instead of radians.
* By default `st_network_paths()` now encodes nodes by their name, whenever a name attribute is present in the nodes table. This can be disabled by setting `use_names = FALSE`. Refs [#154](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/154).
* Functions `sf::st_precision()` and `sf::st_set_precision()` now have a method for `sfnetwork` objects, such that coordinate precision can be queried and set. Refs [#209](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/209).
* Functions `sf::st_intersection()` and `sf::st_difference()` now have a method for `sfnetwork` objects, such that networks can be spatially clipped. The method for `sf::st_crop()` now uses the same workflow. These functions do not work yet on edges of undirected networks. Refs [#133](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/133).
* Function `sf::st_drop_geometry()` is now a generic and therefore got an `sfnetwork` method.
* Several other sf functions got an `sfnetwork` method, merely to be consistent in the type of functions we provide a method for. Only those functions that mutate the geometry column of an sf object in such a way that would break the valid spatial network structure are not supported.
* Methods for `sf::st_coordinates()`, `sf::st_bbox()` and `sf::st_crs()` gained an `active` argument such that this information can be extracted from any network element without first activating it. Refs [#215](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/215).

### Bug fixes

* Rd files do not contain code anymore that is incompatible with HTML5. Refs [#221](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/221).
* Print methods now return x invisibly. Refs [#217](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/217).

### Refactoring

* Error messages when edge measure or query functions are applied to a network with active nodes, or when node measure or query functions are applied to a network with active edges, are now more informative. Refs [#216](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/216).
* Calculating straight-line distances of edges is now more performant. Refs [#180](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/180).
* Edge measure function `edge_circuity()` does not return units objects anymore, since circuity is unitless.

### Community

* Vignettes updated to showcase new features.
* Code of conduct updated according to newer template.
* Contributing guidelines extended with templates for commit messages.
* Master branch renamed to main, and protected from directed pushes.

# sfnetworks v0.5.5

* Adjusted the code used to check the version of PROJ on attach. In particular, the new approach tests only `sf::sf_extSoftVersion()["proj.4"]` since `sf::sf_extSoftVersion()["PROJ"]` might not be defined for sf < 1.0. Refs [#198](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/198) and [#200](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/200). 
* Adjusted one of the vignettes following the changes in `dplyr` 1.0.8. Ref [#202](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/pull/202). Thanks @romainfrancois. 
* Removed conflicting URL from package documentation `spatial_edge_measures`
  
# sfnetworks v0.5.4

* A startup message is included to urge users of PROJ <= 6 to recreate the CRS for the `Roxel` dataset. Refs [#190](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/190) and fixed with [#193](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/pull/193).
* Example using GraphML in [vignette 1](https://luukvdmeer.github.io/sfnetworks/articles/sfn01_structure.html) has been removed provisionally to address [#194](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/194).

# sfnetworks v0.5.3

* Addition of the `n_active` and `n_inactive` arguments to the print method of an sfnetwork object. The arguments define how many rows are printed for respectively the active and inactive network element. The values of these arguments can also be set globally by running e.g. `options(sfn_max_print_active = 1, sfn_max_print_inactive = 2)`. Refs [#157](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/157)
* The example dataset `Roxel` is updated to comply with recent updates on the way a CRS is specified in an sf object. Refs [#167](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/167)
* GitHub Actions workflows are updated to comply with new developments.
* Documentation updates:
  - Vignette file names are updated such that the appear in correct order on CRAN. Refs [#162](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/162)
  - Example section of the plot method for sfnetwork objects now includes an example of how to add graticules and axes. Refs [#159](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/159)

# sfnetworks v0.5.2

* Compatibility with `s2` by adding a `s2::as_s2_geography()` method for sfnetwork objects. In the new version of `sf`, the `s2` package will be used for geometric operations involving longitude-latitude coordinates, see [here](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/issues/1649).
* Bug fixes:
  - When setting `length_as_weight = TRUE` in the sfnetwork construction function, the added weight column now preserves specification of units.
  - `st_network_blend()` now internally uses `sf::st_cast()` instead of `sfheaders::sfc_cast()` to avoid errors with some CRS specifications.
* Documentation updates:
  - Extended documentation for the shortest paths functions.
  - Clear mention in vignettes that `tidygraph` behavior regarding the `weight` attribute settings is sometimes differing from `igraph`.

# sfnetworks v0.5.1

* Compatibility with `spatstat v2`, which is now splitted into multiple sub-packages. See [here](https://github.com/spatstat/spatstat/tree/v1.64-2#spatstat-is-now-split-into-several-packages) for details. In `sfnetworks`, this affected the functions `as_sfnetwork.linnet()`, `as_sfnetwork.psp()` and `as.linnet.sfnetwork()`. Using this functions now requires `spatstat >= 2.0.0` and `sf >= 0.9.8`.
* Bug fixes:
  - Usage of `match` for checking coordinate equality is replaced by a new `st_match` function specifically designed for this task. This fixes bugs related to numeric approximations of detailed coordinates. See [#130](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/130)
* Documentation updates:
  - It is now clearly documented that using `sf::st_reverse()` to reverse edge linestrings is only possible with GEOS versions >= 3.7.

# sfnetworks v0.5.0 "Nienberge"

* Addition of a `to_spatial_contracted()` morpher, to contract groups of nodes based on given grouping variables. Refs [#104](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/104)
* Addition of a `to_spatial_neighborhood()` morpher, to limit a network to the neighborhood of a given node, based on a given cost threshold. Refs [#90](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/90)
* New implementation of `st_network_blend()`, which is faster and more reliable. The `sort` argument is deprecated, since the returned network is now always sorted.
* Addition of an `summarise_attributes` argument to the `to_spatial_simple()` morpher, allowing to specify on a per-attribute basis how attribute values of merged multiple edges should be inferred from the original ones. Refs [#113](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/113). The same argument is also part of the new `to_spatial_contracted()` morpher, where it can be used to specify on a per-attribute basis how attribute values of contracted groups of nodes should be inferred from the original ones.
* The argument `remove_parallels` of the `to_spatial_simple()` morpher is renamed to `remove_multiples` to better fit naming conventions in `igraph`.
* The argument `store_orig_data` of the `to_spatial_smooth()` morpher is renamed to `store_original_data` to be better interpretable. This argument is also added to the morphers `to_spatial_simple()` and `to_spatial_contracted()`, allowing to store original node or edge data in a `.orig_data` column, matching the design standards of `tidygraph`.
* Addition of a `Inf_as_NaN` argument to `st_network_cost()`, to store cost values of paths between unconnected edges as `NaN` instead of `Inf`. The default value of this argument is `FALSE`. Refs [#111](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/111)
* The default of the `Inf_as_NaN` argument in `edge_circuity()` is changed from `TRUE` to `FALSE`, to better fit with the change mentioned above, and to make sure no changes to R defaults are made without the user explicitly specifying them.
* Whenever there are multiple matches when spatially joining information to the nodes of a network with `sf::st_join()`, only the information of the first match is now joined. Before, this used to throw an error. Refs [#108](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/discussions/108)
* Removal of the morphed_sfnetwork method for `sf::st_geometry<-`, since geometries should not be replaced in a morphed state.
* The warning '.. assumes attributes are constant over geometries' is now only raised when not all attribute-geometry relationships are set to 'constant'. Refs [#123](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/123)
* Bug fixes:
  - The attribute-geometry relationships of edge attributes are now preserved during network construction. Fixes [#123](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/123)
  - `st_network_blend()` now correctly blends points that are very close to the network. Fixes [#98](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/98)
  - `st_network_blend()` now preserves the directedness of the input network. Fixes [#127](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/127)
  - `st_network_blend()` now runs even if the network contains edges of length 0. Fixes [#125](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/125)
  - The sfnetwork method for `sf::st_crop()` now correctly updates the nodes table after cropping the edges. Fixes [#109](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/109)
  - `to_spatial_smooth()` now returns the original network when no pseudo nodes are present. Fixes [#112](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/112)
  - `to_spatial_subdivision()` now returns the original network when there are no locations for subdivision.
  - `to_spatial_subdivision()` now returns correct node indices for undirected networks.
* Several new examples and applications added to the vignettes.

# sfnetworks v0.4.1

* Addition of an edge measure function `edge_azimuth()`, to calculate the azimuth (i.e. bearing) of edges. Refs [#107](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/107)
* Addition of a `to_spatial_transformed()` morpher, to temporarily transform a sfnetwork into a different CRS.
* Addition of a sfnetwork methods for `linnet` objects, to enhance interoperability between `sfnetworks` and the `spatstat` package for spatial point patterns on linear networks.
* Addition of an `Inf_as_NaN` argument to the `edge_circuity()` function, to store circuity values of loop edges as `NaN` instead of `Inf`. The default value of this argument is `TRUE`.
* Changes to `st_network_paths()`:
  - Addition of a new argument `type`, which lets you set the type of paths calculation that should be performed.
  - To calculate all shortest paths between nodes, now set `type = 'all_shortest'` instead of `all = TRUE`. The latter argument is deprecated.
  - Besides shortest paths, there is now also the possibility to calculate all simple paths between nodes, by setting `type = 'all_simple'`. Be aware that computation time gets high when providing a lot of 'to' nodes, or when the network is large and dense. Refs [#105](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/105)
  - Whenever `weights = NULL` *and* there is no column named 'weight' in the edges table, geographic edge length will be calculated internally and used as weights in shortest path calculation. Before, paths would be calculated without edge weights in this case. Refs [#106](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/106)
  - Whenever the given 'from' and/or 'to' nodes contain NA values and/or empty point geometries, igraph behaviour is now replicated by throwing an error. Before, these values would simply be ignored.
* Performance improvement of the `to_spatial_smooth()` morpher. As a result of this it does not store the original edge data anymore in a '.orig_data' column. Instead, non-merged edges keep their attributes, while merged edges loose their attributes. The '.orig_data' column can still be added by setting `store_orig_data = TRUE`, but this is not the default.
* Bug fixes:
  - `st_network_paths()` now correctly handles cases where an unexisting column is passed to the `weights` argument, by throwing an error. Fixes [#99](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/99)
  - The sfnetwork method for `sf::st_join()` now correctly handles inner joins (i.e. joins where `left = FALSE`).
* Addition of extra examples to the [routing](https://luukvdmeer.github.io/sfnetworks/articles/sfn04_routing.html) and [spatial morphers](https://luukvdmeer.github.io/sfnetworks/articles/sfn05_morphers.html) vignettes.
* Test coverage increased to +/- 86%.

# sfnetworks v0.4.0 "Hiltrup"

* Backward incompatible changes to existing functions:
  - Function `st_shortest_paths()` and `st_all_shortest_paths()` are now merged into a single function `st_network_paths()`. By default it call `igraph::shortest_paths()` internally. Setting `all = TRUE` will make it call `igraph::all_shortest_paths()` instead.
  - The output format of this `st_network_paths()` function is different from its predecessors. It returns a tibble instead of a list, to fit better in tidyverse workflows. See [#77](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/77)
  - The `snap` argument is removed from all shortest paths related functions, which will now always snap geospatial points provides as from or to locations to their nearest node on the network before calculating paths.
  - The `keep` argument is removed from the `to_spatial_simple()` morpher. It is now recommended to first sort data with `dplyr::arrange()` before calling the morpher.
  - The spatial morpher `to_spatial_coordinates()` is deprecated. Use the new node coordinate query functions instead.
  - The spatial morpher `to_spatial_dense_graph()` is deprecated. A new morpher `to_spatial_subdivision()`, with slightly different functionality, is added instead.
  - The spatial morpher `to_spatial_implicit_edges()` is deprecated. Use `sf::st_set_geometry()` instead, with activated edges and value `NULL`.
  - Functions `st_network_distance()`, `edge_straight_length()` and `to_spatial_explicit_edges()` are renamed to respectively `st_network_cost()`, `edge_displacement()` and `to_spatial_explicit()`, which either reflects their purpose better or fits better into the naming conventions within the package.
  - Function arguments that were named `graph` are renamed to `x`, to have more consistency across the package.
* Backward compatible changes to existing functions:
  - The construction function `sfnetwork()` now has an argument `length_as_weight` that, if set to TRUE, will add the lengths of edges as a weight attribute to the edges data. Refs [#65](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/65)
  - There is now an `as_sfnetwork()` method for sfc objects. Refs [#41](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/41)
  - All existing `st_network_*` functions in sfnetwork are now generic, such that they can easily be modified by extensions of sfnetwork objects. Refs [#80](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/80)
  - The `to_spatial_explicit_edges()` morpher now accepts arguments that are forwarded directly to `sf::st_as_sf()`. Refs [#83](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/83)
  - Functions that split edges now give a warning that attributes are assumed to be constant. Refs [#84](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/84)
  - The `edge_length()` function can now also be applied to spatially implicit edges.
  - The sfnetwork methods for `sf::st_as_sf()`, `sf::st_geometry()` and `sf::st_agr()` now have an argument `active` to directly retrieve information from a network element without activating it. Use as `st_as_sf(x, active = "nodes")`, et cetera.
  - Character encoded node names can now be provided as from and to locations to the shortest path functions.
* New functions:
  - The new function `st_network_blend()` implements a process that we called 'blending points into a network'. The functions accepts a network and a set of points. For each point p in the set of given points, it finds the projection p\* of p on the network, splits the edges of the network at the location of p\*, and finally adds p\* along with the attributes of p as a node to the network. Refs [#27](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/27) and [#54](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/27)
  - The new function `st_network_join()` does a network specific join of two sfnetworks. It combines a spatial full join on the nodes data with a bind_rows operation on the edges data, and updates the from and to indices of the edges accordingly. Refs [#22](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/22)
  - The new function `st_network_bbox()` calculates the bounding box of the whole network by combining the bounding boxes of nodes and edges.
  - The new spatial morpher `to_spatial_subdivision()` subdivides edges at locations where an interior point is shared with either another interior point or endpoint of another edge. Refs [#73](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/73)
  - The new spatial morpher `to_spatial_smooth()` iteratively removes pseudo-nodes from the network. Refs [#70](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/70)
  - Several spatial predicate functions are implemented as node and edge query functions, to interpret spatial relations between network elements and other geospatial features directly inside tidy filter and mutate calls. Refs [#60](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/60)
  - Node coordinate query functions `node_X()`, `node_Y()`, `node_Z()` and `node_M()` are implemented to query specific coordinate values from the nodes.
  - There is now an `ggplot2::autoplot()` method for sfnetworks, allowing to easily plot a sfnetwork as a ggplot2 object. Refs [#86](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/86)
  - There is now a `print` method for morphed sfnetworks. Refs [#88](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/88)
  - There are now morphed sfnetworks method for `sf::st_geometry<-()`, `sf::st_join()`, `sf::st_filter()` and `sf::st_crop()`. Refs [#85](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/85)
* Bug fixes:
  - Networks can now be constructed by only providing nodes, and no edges. Fixes [#81](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/81)
  - The print method for sfnetwork objects now correctly handles networks without edges as well as completely empty networks. Fixes [#69](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/69) and [#89](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/89)
  - The shortest path functions now correctly handle empty geometries. Fixes [#87](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/87)
* Documentation improvements:
  - Examples are added to the function documentations. Refs [#45](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/45)
  - The existing vignettes are reorganized, and combined with a lot of new information into five new vignettes. Refs [#92](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/92)
* Together with the documentation improvements, several new units tests brought the test coverage to +/- 80%.
* The internal code base is completely restructured, such that it is more performant and easier to read, debug and extend.

# sfnetworks v0.3.1

* Bug fixes:
  - `as_sfnetwork()` now handles circular linestrings. Fixes [#59](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/59)
* Addition of a "node_key" argument to the construction functions, in line with the recent update of tidygraph. Refs [#53](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/53)
* Better integration with Z and M coordinates by adding them as coordinate columns when calling spatial morpher `to_spatial_coordinates()`. Refs [#62](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/62)
* Improved pkgdown structure. Refs [#44](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/44)
* First implementation of continuous benchmarking. Refs [#6](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/6)

# sfnetworks v0.3.0 "Gievenbeck"

* Several spatial network extensions for the tidygraph and sf functionalities:
  - Spatial wrappers around igraph shortest paths functions. Refs [#28](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/28)
  - Various spatial morpher functions. Refs [#19](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/19)
  - Various edge measure algorithms, including edge circuity. Refs [#51](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/51)
* More methods for `as_sfnetwork()`. Refs [#41](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/41)
  - Support `sfNetwork` from [stplanr](https://docs.ropensci.org/stplanr/)
  - Support [linnet](https://rdrr.io/cran/spatstat.linnet/man/linnet.html) and [psp](https://rdrr.io/cran/spatstat.geom/man/psp.object.html) from [spatstat](https://rdrr.io/cran/spatstat/)
* Preserving sf attributes for nodes and edges inside the sfnetwork object. Refs [#24](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/24)
* Structural and performance improvements of the code base. This includes:
  - Construction checks are run only when needed, adding a force argument to skip validity tests.
  - Allowing to choose between spatially explicit and implicit edges during construction, adding an edges_as_lines argument. Refs [#47](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/47)
  - Using st_boundary to find line endpoints increases performance for sfnetwork construction from sf objects. Refs [#30](https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/30)
  - Cleaning up sf methods for sfnetwork objects.
  - Relying on internally stored attributes rather than first extracting sf objects.
  - Option to plot without making edges explicit.
* Improved function documentation.
* An additional vignette "Extensions" was included.
